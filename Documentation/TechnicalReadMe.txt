Crafting Life is an element gathering and crafting game produced during the MassDiGI Summer Innovation Program.

As such, the Unity project is broken into two major sections: Gathering (also sometimes called “Collection”) and Crafting. These make up the gameplay.

Crafting Life also implements a Neuro’motion SDK used to connect to Low Energy Bluetooth devices and monitor heart rate.

The game has Mixpanel integration for analytics.

It uses multiple CSV files to store and read in data. It uses a large amount of 2d assets compressed as sprite sheets.

It makes generous use of Unity’s UI library/components.

There are individual ReadMe’s for each of the major folders within the Unity projects (look inside Assets).
